# Xbox One Arm-Cycle-Controller

The Xbox One Arm-Cycle-Controller is an exercise device that interfaces with the Xbox Adaptive Controller to produce an interactive fitness experience targeted towards users with spinal cord injuries. 

The device functions as an electromechanical adapter that adds controller functionality to a commercial mini-exercise bicycle through the use of control signals derived from encoder and inertial measurements. The control signals are interpreted by the Xbox Adaptive Controller as joystick and trigger inputs, allowing the device to play racing games on Xbox One Series consoles or Windows 10 PCs.

## Project Background
Individuals with physical disabilities often have limited options to be physically active. A popular form of cardiovascular exercise for people with Spinal Cord Injuries (SCIs) is ‘hand cycling’. At the Physical Activity Research Centre (PARC), users with SCIs can engage in many physical exercise activities while building social connections within their community. 

With the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the initial closure of PARC, it was clear that there was a need for a new home-based exercise device for individuals with SCIs. The goal of this Capstone project, was to develop an Arm Cycle Controller, compatible with the Xbox adaptive controller for Xbox One Series consoles and Windows 10 PCs. The final product is aimed at bringing an inexpensive and engaging exercise experience into the end user’s home, one that can foster community through online engagement.
